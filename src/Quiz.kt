/*
Self-Grading Quiz
Working at a school that has recently switched to e-learning tactics, you have been assigned the task of creating a self-grading quiz program for the math class.

Using your knowledge of Kotlin and conditionals, you will create a program that collects and checks a studentâ€™s answers and then gives them a final letter grade.
